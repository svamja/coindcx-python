Common Notes:

- All the Authenticated API calls use POST method.
- Parameters are to be passed as JSON in the request body.
- Every request must contain a timestamp parameter of when the request was generated. This timestamp is used to validate that the request is not a very old one (due to some lag in any layer) - the request is rejected with an appropriate error if this timestamp deviates too much from the server's time at which it is received to be processed.

The authentication procedure is as follows:

- The payload is the parameters object, JSON encoded
`payload = parameters-object -> JSON encode`  

- The signature is the hex digest of an HMAC-SHA256 hash where the message is your payload, and the secret key is your API secret.
`signature = HMAC-SHA256(payload, api-secret).digest('hex')`  


After this, You will have to add following headers into all the authenticated requests

| Header Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| X-AUTH-APIKEY | your-api-key |
| X-AUTH-SIGNATURE | signature |


 You must replace `your-api-key` and `signature` with your personal API key and generated signature respectively.

# Spot Sockets

There are two types of channels

1. Private (requires authentication)
2. Public (doesn’t require authentication)


PUBLIC 

To connect to public socket

Refer to the right panel.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.coindcx.com/exchange/v1/derivatives/futures/data/instrument?pair={instrument}&margin_currency_short_name={futures_margin_mode}`

### Response Defnitions

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| settle_currency_short_name | Currency in which you buy/sell futures contracts |
| quote_currency_short_name | Currency in which you see the price of the futures contract |
| position_currency_short_name | Underlying crypto on which the futures contract is created |
| underlying_currency_short_name | Underlying crypto on which the futures contract is created |
| status | Status of the instrument. Possible values are “active“ and “inactive“. |
| pair | Instrument Pair name. This is the format in which the input of the pairs will be given in any API request. |
| kind | CoinDCX only supports perpetual contracts for now, so this value will always be “perpetual” |
| settlement | This will be the settlement date of the contract. It will be “never” for perpetual contracts |
| max_leverage_long | Ignore this |
| max_leverage_short | Ignore this |
| unit_contract_value | This will be equal to 1 for all the Perpetual futures |
| price_increment | If price increment is 0.1 then price inputs for limit order can be x, x+0.1, x+0.1*2, x+0.1*3, etc |
| quantity_increment | If qty increment is 0.1 then qty inputs for an order can be x, x+0.1, x+0.1*2, x+0.1*3, etc |
| min_trade_size | This is the minimum quantity of a trade that can be settled on exchange. |
| min_price | Minimum amount to enter the position |
| max_price | Maximum amount to enter the position |
| min_quantity | Minimum quantity to enter the position |
| max_quantity | Maximum quantity to enter the position |
| min_notional | Minimum value you can purchase for a symbol |
| maker_fee | Maker fees mean when you add liquidity to the market by placing a new order that isn’t immediately matched. |
| taker_fee | Taker fees mean when you remove liquidity by filling an existing order. |
| safety_percentage | Ignore this |
| quanto_to_settle_multiplier | Ignore this. This will be equal to 1 |
| is_inverse | Ignore this. This will be false |
| is_quanto | Ignore this. This will be false |
| allow_post_only | Ignore this |
| allow_hidden | Ignore this |
| max_market_order_quantity | This gives the maximum allowed quantity in a market order |
| funding_frequency | Number of hours after which funding happens. If the value is 8 that means the funding happens every 8 hours. |
| max_notional | Ignore this |
| exit_only | If this is true then you can’t place fresh orders to take a new position or add more to an existing position. Although you can reduce your existing positions and cancel your open orders. If you already have open orders to add positions, they will not be impacted. |
| multiplier_up | This denotes how aggressive your limit buy orders can be placed compared to LTP. For example if the LTP is 100 and you want to place a buy order. The limit price has to be between minPrice and LTP*(1+multiplierUp/100) |
| multiplier_down | This denotes how aggressive your limit sell orders can be placed compared to LTP. For example if the LTP is 100 and you want to place a sell order. The limit price has to be between maxPrice and LTP*(1-multiplierDown/100) |
| liquidation_fee | This denotes Applicable fee if the trade received for the order is a trade for the liquidation order |
| dynamic_position_leverage_details | Sample response:  {   "5":15000000.0,  "8":5000000.0,  "10":1000000.0,  "15":500000.0,  "20":100000.0,  "25":50000.0  }  This gives you the max allowed leverage for a given position size. So for example if your positions size is 120K which is higher than 100K and less than 500K USDT, then max allowed leverage is 15x |
| dynamic_safety_margin_details | Sample response:  {  "50000":1.5,  "100000":2.0,  "500000":3.0,  "1000000":5.0,  "5000000":6.0,  "15000000":10.0  }  This gives you the calculation for maintenance margin of the position. In the above example, if you have a position size of 60K USDT, then your maintenance margin will be 50K*1.5% + 10K*2% = 950 USDT.Your position will be liquidated when the margin available in your position goes below 950 USDT. Liquidation price is calculated using this number and will be updated in the get position endpoint |
| expiry_time | Ignore this |
| time_in_force_options | Time in force indicates how long your order will remain active before it is executed or expired. Possible values are good_till_cancel, immediate_or_cancel, fill_or_kill |
| margin_currency_short_name | Futures margin mode |

# FAQ

**From where to start**

Refer **[Setup](#setup)** section for the details

**Authentication**

**1. How to generate Key and Secret for a user**

Refer **[Setup](#setup)** section for the details

**2. Can a user have multiple Key and Secret**

Yes, there are no restriction on creating Key and Secret.

**3. Are there Read Only APIs available for CoinDCX Public APIs**

No, we currently don't have Read Only APIs.

**4. Can the same API Key be regenerated once it gets deleted**

No, you’ll need to generate a new API key and secret for security purposes.

**5. Can I use the same API key secret everytime also can I share them with someone else**

Since all API users have the same level of permissions, API keys are interchangeable. However in case  
you choose to bind API keys with IP addresses, you might need to create a different API key for every user.

**General API**

**1. What are the rate limits applicable on CoinDCX APIs**

16/sec, 960/min

**2. In the case of an API failure what is the HTTP status code returned by the CoinDCX APIs?**

In the case of API failure you get a 5xx error. The 2 applicable errors are:  


- 500: Internal Server Error. This is a one-off error that happens due to internal issues on CoinDCX’s side
- 503: Service Unavailable. This error is thrown when there is a downtime at CoinDCX. These should get resolved fairly quickly.


For scheduled downtimes, you would receive prior notification over e-mail from the email ID [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) among other CoinDCX email IDs.   
Please add us to your address-book so as to not miss such important emails.

**3. What is High Frequency Trading**

High frequency trading refers to trading activity done through automated programs that generally take advantage of market inefficiencies to make money.

**4. What's the maximum size of a trade that can be executed via APIs**

This can be found from the max_quantity key from [Market Details API](#markets-details).This detail is available at a per pair/market level and depends on the Exchange that you are trading on.

**5. Is there any API that's available to list all the trading transactions of the account**

Yes, you can use the [Account Trade History API](#account-trade-history) for the same.  
API keys are different for master and sub account and so are the trade history APIs.

**6. How do sub accounts work with APIs**

API keys are different for master and sub accounts and so are the trades and trade histories.

**7. Is any data available without authentication through API Key and Secret**

The following data is available without authentication: 

- In REST APIs here’s a [list of public endpoints](#public-endpoints) that don’t need an authentication
- In Websockets, the order book and market data is available without authentication

**8. Is Futures trading available through Public APIs**

No, currently this feature is not available.

**Markets**

**1. How to evaluate order quantity with the combination of min_quantity / max_quantity and precision**

To derive quantity value for an order both min_quantity and precision condition should meet.  
So as example shared by user when min_quantity = 0.001 and target precision = 2 in this case   
order quantity cannot be less than 0.01 this satisfy both the condition of min_quantity and target precision.

**2. How to get Market specific data (Ex: status, min_quantity, max_quantity, target precision etc)**

`GET /exchange/v1/markets_details` API can be use to fetch this data, the response of this API contains   
parameter related to specific market.  
For example base_currency_precision, target_currency_precision, min_quantity, max_quantity etc. [API Link](#markets-details)

**3. How to get Candles data for a market**

`GET /market_data/candles?pair=B-BTC_USDT&interval=1m` API can be use to fetch candle data. [API Link](#candles)

**4. Is there a place, where I can get the full report of 52 week high, 52 week low, 24hr, 1week,1hr data.**

Yes, this can be fetched from the [Candles API](#candles).

**5. What is the difference between fee and fee_amount that is received in the response of New Order and Multiple Orders API**

The parameter `fee` returns the fee percentage charged on the transaction whereas the `fee_amount` parameter returns the absolute amount of fee charged in the base currency.

**6. How can the prices for a particular market be fetched**

You can fetch the OHLC (Open, High, Low and Close) data for various intervals from the [Candles API](#candles) for a particuar market.

**7. How should we determine the minimum quantity for a particular market**

Please use the following steps to determine the minimum quantity that can be traded for a particular market:   
1. Please fetch the min_quantity from [Market Details API](#markets-details).  
2. Please fetch the target_currency_precision from [Market Details API](#markets-details). If the target currency precision is 2 that can be interpreted as the minimum quantity available to be 0.01.  
3. The maximum of the above 2 values would give you the minimum quantity that you can order for a particular market.   
Hence if the min_quantity returns 0.0001 and the target_currency_precision is 2, then the min quantity allowed is actually 0.01 and not 0.0001.

**Orders**

**1. How to find available order types for a market**

The available order types for a particular pair/market can be obtained from order_types param of the Market Details API. These can then used accordingly while creating Orders

**2. What are the meanings of the different kinds of orders available?**

Please refer to this [article](https://dcxlearn.com/trading/what-are-different-types-of-orders-market-stop-limit-and-more/) for more information on this topic

**3. How can one calculate the tentative order value before placing an order**

This would depend on the kind of order that you’d like to place. 

- In case of limit value this can be calculated with the price and quantity you’d like to set.
- In case of market value, this can be calculated by fetching the latest prices from the Candles API and multiplying with the quantity you’d like to order. The final price will however depend on the market conditions.
- In case of stop limit order, the price you’d set would determine the

**4. For a failed transaction will there be a fee charged**

No fee would be applicable on a failed transaction.

**5. How can the total open orders for a particular pair be found**

This can be done in 2 ways:

- Using the [Order Book Rest API](#order-book)
- Using the “depth-update” [event](#order-book) in various market specific channels

**6. What is the max length of the client order id**

The maximum allowed length is 36 characters

**7. What are the various reasons for which orders could not be placed**

There could be several reasons because of which an order could not be placed. Some of these are listed below: 

- There isn’t enough balance present in the user's wallet
- Rate limits have been hit
- The order type sent is not present for the market
- The mandatory fields needed to execute the order are not sent

**8. What are the various reasons for which orders could be rejected after getting placed**

There could be several edge cases because of which an order could be placed but rejected at a later stage. One of them is that in case of market orders, the order value could go below the min notional value of the market.

**Sockets**

**1. On websockets for orderbooks, are the updates a snapshot or an incremental update**

On orderbook related data on CoinDCX Websockets are snapshot updates only.

**2. On websockets, what is the depth of orderbook updates available**

Every new update event will have upto 50 recent orders

**3. Can I only get the order book upto a certain depth (for ex: top 10 only)**

This functionality is not available. Every order book update event will give a update of upto 50 recent orders

**4. Are there private channels on CoinDCX Websockets? How do I access them?**

Publicly available data like market data and order book are available on public channels. On private channels, user specific information like New orders, order updates,user balance update are available. These can be accessed post authentication via API key and secret. Please see the following for [more details](#sockets)

**5. Is there a way to use CoinDCX websockets without socket.io.**

CoinDCX Websockets are currently implemented via Socket.io. This is the only officially supported library for our websockets.

**User Data**

**1. How can I get my balances and update in balance via APIs**

There are 2 ways to fetch this data:

- You can use our REST APIs [here](#get-balances)
- You can also get this data via our websockets by following the steps [here](#balances)

**2. Can I get my fee tier via APIs**

We currently don't have this available on our APIs

**Handling Errors**

**1. “Invalid Request”**

This happens when there is something incorrect in the request body. These could be: 

- Not sending all mandatory params
- Not sending the right values in the query params
- Not using the right JSON structure in the request body


Please re-check the request params and values you are passing in the request.

**2. “Order type not allowed”**

This happens when particular order type is not allowed for the market For example: BTCINR market has only limit and market type orders, so user won’t be able to place stop_limit orders for BTCINR market.
 Allowed order type for a market can be checked from [Market Details API](#markets-details).

**3. “Too Many Requests”**

This happens when user makes too many API calls which leads to rate limit for a user.

**4. “This order cannot be cancelled”**

This happens when the order id passed in the request body is in filled, cancelled or rejected status. Order can be cancelled only when its in open or partially_filled status.
 Order status of an order can be checked using [Order Status API](#order-status).

**5. “packet queue is empty, aborting”**

This happens when connection with the socket is lost. In this case please connect with the socket again and re-join the channel.
